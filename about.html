            Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square
            miles, the terrain is diverse and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush
            tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an
            indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was
            dominated by fishing or agriculture.

            <h3>Stocking Up on Supplies</h3>
            <p class="blog-meta">Posted July 6, 2025</p>
            <p class="blog-preview">
                Whether you need sunscreen, bottled water, or some late-night snacks, Taniti has you covered.
                <span class="blog-more hidden">
                    The island offers two full-size supermarkets and two smaller grocery stores. For night owls or
                    last-minute needs, there's a <strong>24-hour convenience store</strong>, perfect for grabbing
                    sunscreen before your morning hike or snacks for your beach day. <br><br>
                    Tip: Since Taniti uses the U.S. dollar and most shops accept major credit cards (plus euros and
                    yen), you won’t need to worry about exchanging too much cash up front.

            <h3>How to Travel Like a Local</h3>
            <p class="blog-meta">Posted July 6, 2025</p>
            <p class="blog-preview">
                Taniti is easy to explore no matter your style of travel.
                <span class="blog-more hidden">
                    If you're staying in Taniti City, public buses run daily from <strong>5 a.m. to 11 p.m.</strong> and
                    the city itself is very walkable — especially the Merriton Landing area. <br><br>
                    Want more freedom? <strong>Rental cars</strong> are available near the airport, and <strong>bicycles
                        with helmets</strong> can be rented throughout the city (helmets are required by law). For
                    broader island access, <strong>private buses and taxis</strong> also operate and are fairly easy to
                    use.

            <h3>Taniti Nightlife: Quiet Evenings or Dancing</h3>
            <p class="blog-meta">Posted July 6, 2025</p>
            <p class="blog-preview">
                Taniti might be known for its beaches, but its nightlife is quietly blossoming.
                <span class="blog-more hidden">
                    You’ll find <strong>several pubs</strong>, a local <strong>microbrewery</strong>, and a <strong>new
                        dance club</strong> that stays lively until midnight — the legal cutoff for alcohol sales. Movie
                    lovers, arcade players, and art enthusiasts will also find options around <strong>Merriton
                        Landing</strong>. <br><br>
                    Tip: The drinking age is 18, and although the law isn't strictly enforced, alcohol can't be
                    sold or served from midnight to 9 a.m.
